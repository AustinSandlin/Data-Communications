# Data-Communications
This repository contains the source code and various libraries for my Baylor Fall 2015 Data Communictions project.

DISCLAMER: All files within the 'src' file are written by me. With the exception of the 'passwords.txt' file, all files outside the src file were provided by the professor.

The goal of this project was to experiment with several paired clients and servers that communicate via different TCP and UDP communication standards. The end result was a single server that could deserialize and handle information provided by multiple clients simultaneously and provide a visual representation of all the clientâ€™s geographical locations, as well as location update notifications via UDP.
